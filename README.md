# Java-Racing-Game

A non-GUI rolling dice racing game with different obstacles, which supports saving the state of the game at defined checkpoints.

The game starts with the user entering the total number of tiles on the race track. Each tile represents one position in one dimension. A tile can be of type Snake, Vulture, Cricket, White, or Trampoline. This is a single player game and once the game starts, its the computer who plays the game without any user intervention, and continues playing until the player wins.

Each type of tile has a certain effect of the current position of the player.

Finally, 'Game.java' contains the entire sourceCode, so run this file to play the game.
